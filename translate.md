# Translate everything!

[`⬅️ Go back`](./readme.md)

This document describes some requirements and rules to follow when translating contents of this repository.
This document will not be translated into any other language since it is expected from all translators to know English.

## Translating the app itself

The app consists of two modules: `:app` and `:widgetFactory`. 
When translating *from scratch*, you should provide translations for both modules.

Translating the documentation is not necessary but much appreciated, 
since seeing a translation on app's homepage will automatically tell people that the app itself is translated.

## Translating documentation

When translating documentation *from scratch*. translate all the pages.
Also, when translating first time, add your country's flag button to the main `readme.md` and all of it's translations.
Files should be named like this: `readme.<code>.md`, where `<code>` is yor language's code.
After you did all of the translation work, check your files for typos and also ensure all the links are pointing to translated documents.

## Translating imagery

Documentation contains imagery with text. 
If it is not translated into your language yet, add a table with translations into your pull request's description.
It should look like this:

|    Original text    | Translation |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Quick Settings Tile | <...>       |
| Home Screen Widgets | <...>       |
| ...                 | ...         |
