<p><i>WADBS</i> (short for <i>Wireless Android Debugging Bridge Switch</i>) is an app that allows you to switch Android's Wireless Debugging feature on and off quickly. It provides several widgets and a quick settings tile to do this. You can also instantly connect to your PC using KDE Connect's clipboard sharing feature (see <a href='https://github.com/Smooth-E/wireless-adb-switch/blob/main/scripts/readme.md' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>scripts</a>).</p>
