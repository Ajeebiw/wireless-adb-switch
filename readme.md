**WADBS** (short or **Wireless Android Debugging Bridge Switch**) is an app that allows you to switch Android's Wireless Debugging feature on and off quickly.
It provides several widgets and a quick settings tile to do this. 
You can also instantly connect to your PC using KDE Connect's clipboard sharing feature (see [scripts](./scripts/)).
